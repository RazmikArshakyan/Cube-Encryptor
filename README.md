# Cube Encryptor

## Overview

Cube Encryptor is a simple yet powerful tool for text encryption and decryption, employing a unique cube-based algorithm. The process involves pasting a letter list on a cube, generating a key, and performing rotations and substitutions to achieve secure encryption and decryption of text.

## Features

### Encryption:

- Accepts a plaintext string.
- Generates a key for encryption.
- Rotates the cube based on the key.
- Performs substitution based on the original orientation of the cube.
- Generates and returns the ciphertext.

### Decryption:

- Accepts a ciphertext string and the encryption key.
- Rotates the cube based on the key.
- Performs substitution based on the orientation of the cube.
- Recovers the plaintext and reinitializes the letter list with the new state.
